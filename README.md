# Inverse Kinematics system

This project is a small exercise in order to work around Inverse Kinematics.

The idea is to simulate joint movements by implementing a basic inverse kinematics system using the FABRIK algorithm.
The "bones" objects follow the mouse location at runtime and the joint system takes into account angle restrictions in its rotations.
